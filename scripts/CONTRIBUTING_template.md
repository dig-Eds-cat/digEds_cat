# How to contribute a digital edition to the _Catalogue_

## Inclusion criteria
The project is constantly evolving as users request more features and development on the [web app](https://github.com/dig-Eds-cat/dig-ed-cat-static) moves forward. At the moment we don't accept ebooks, any form of commercial digital books or transcriptions made available via Wikisource, but projects whose authorship can be traced back to one or multiple individuals with, if possible, an institutional affiliation (university and/or GLAM institution). We primarily look for digital editions and digital scholarly editions (by which we mean editions with a strong critical component) but people are also beginning to submit digital archives, textual collections where some texts are treated in more detail, etc. It's worth noting that people define their projects in various ways (e.g. a project may define itself as a database when it fact it might be more of a digital archive) using different terms synonymously. This makes it difficult to pick what should be included in our list or not. The line of inclusion in our catalogue is a little blurry but it reflects the fuzziness that comes with these projects.

## Updating existing entries
If you want to **suggest changes to existing editions**, please add these as issues in this repository with the name of the edition in question. You can suggest edits either via a GitHub pull-request or by telling us in the issue text field what you'd like us to change.

## Contribution options: GitHub
There are **two different ways to contribute a digital edition**: 

1. If you're familiar with GitHub, you know what to do: fork this repository, edit the .csv file and create a pull request. 
2. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/dig-Eds-cat/digEds_cat/issues) with as much information about the edition as possible (see "Data fields" section below). The more information you provide, the sooner the edition will appear in the _Catalogue_.

It's important you're consistent and follow these guidelines for the [web application](https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) to display your contribution correctly.

## Contributing via GitHub
The fields the _Catalogue_ uses to classify information are listed below. Some take free text, others use predefined values. 
The words "**not provided**" are used to indicate that the website or project does not provide the relevant information.
However you choose to contribute a digital edition to the _Catalogue_, please ensure you address as many of the following fields as possible.
